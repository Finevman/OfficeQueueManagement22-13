TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 13)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: 5 vs. 3
- Total points committed vs. done:  15 vs 10
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): 48 vs 44

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _UserLogin_  | 3|GUI_Login_page, GUI_Logged_Used, Login_logic|  7|  7|
| _GetATicket_ | 3|GUI_logic_backend, GUI_services, GUI_logic_frontend|  9|  9|
| _AccessLevels_|2|GUI_Admin, Backend_communication|6|4|

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual) : 
  - Estimate: 0.36, 1.24
  - Actual: 0.4, 2.05
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 : 0.1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - Under estimation of time need to study the chosen technology 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - positive: learn to truck ourselves during the work time
  - negative: complexity on dealing with other team members code and learning their way of writing code.  

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - Don't overevaluate ourselves, we need more time even for task that seems easy.
  - Improve readability of the code, adding more comments and a more specific documentation.

> Propose one or two

 - Our team is reliable, everyone care about the job they had to do.
 - Good communication and fast responses when problem arise.
